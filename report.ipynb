    "## Analysis of trends and company success in the startup world.\n",
    "Our general goal is to analyze the startup world. We are interested in the general state of it, what industries are performing the best, which states look the most promising, and various other data. Additionally we also want to find some success qualifiers for the invvolved companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Data preparation\n",
    "Primariy we read all the data from csv files into pandas dataframes. Additionally we already do a small amount of preprocessing here, for example, taking out only the objects that are companies (instead of people, products...). Snippet for objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "    \n",
    "def get_objects():\n",
    "    return pd.read_csv(\"data/objects.csv\", sep=\",\")\n",
    "investments = get_investments()\n",
    "companies = objects[objects[\"entity_type\"] == \"Company\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We also figure out how much of the data is missing:\n",
    "Total rows: 28716673\n",
    "Total attributes: 145\n",
    "Percentage of missing values: ~32%\n",
    "\n",
    "32% seems like a lot, but it is scattered accross every attributte, and often doesn't signify that a value is missing, but that it doesn't exist (state_code, foor example, is missing in any row where the country isn't US).\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that we removed non US data when doing some of the below tasks. This is because the highest investitions are placed into US companies (and they also make up over 1/4 of  the data)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Basic information\n",
    "Map of startup density by the US state. We can see that by far the most companies are founded in California:\n",

    "## 3. Industry sectors\n",
    "Grouping together sectors/categories, we can see which of them have more companies, and also more total investments. We can see that most companies are in the tech sector, which makes sense, because it's a newere and boomin industry. The highest investments are made into biotech.\n",

    "We also computed some statistic based on the status of companies (operational/non-operational/...) by industry sector.

    "### Predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "Our initial goal was to build a ML model that would predict the success probability of a company given some relevant attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our first attempt, we decided to build a classification tree, but didn't had much success, because the dummy classifier basically outperformed our classification tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue was that the prevalent target class (operating) was a pretty unusefull one. It didn't tell much about the success or failure of the company, it just told us that the company did not fail.\n",

    "| operating | 443663 |\n",
    "\n",
    "We decided to temporarily remove all rows that belong to that class and rather focus on other classes, which could be assigned a success/failure value more easily (ipo=success, closed=failure, failure~success,...), but our metric for success is still quite vague and subjective.\n",
    "\n",
    "We got some better results with this approach. Our dummy model had an accuracy of ~48% and our SVM classifier had 73% accuracy.\n",
    "We tried building different combinations of features, but haven't had much success with any particular one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another idea was to use some dimensionality reduction methods to also get some visual (2d) insights into the data. Our hope was that we would see at least some degree of clustering, but that also wasn't the case.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "Based on our research, we believe that our current dataset doesn't contain the sorts of features that would be appropriate for this kind of prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to better define some company success/failure metrics and then try again. One idea is to mine financial data of public companies (those with status=ipo), which would provide us with better and more standardised metrics for evaluating company success.\n",
