    "## Goals\n",
    "Our general goal is to analyze the startup world. We are interested in the general state of it, what industries are performing the best, which states look the most promising, and various other data. Additionally we also want to find some success qualifiers for the invvolved companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Data preparation\n",
    "Primariy we read all the data from csv files into pandas dataframes. Additionally we already do a small amount of preprocessing here, for example, taking out only the objects that are companies (instead of people, products...). Snippet for objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "    \n",
    "def get_objects():\n",
    "    return pd.read_csv(\"data/objects.csv\", sep=\",\")\n",
    "investments = get_investments()\n",
    "companies = objects[objects[\"entity_type\"] == \"Company\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We also figure out how much of the data is missing:\n",
    "Total rows: 28716673\n",
    "Total attributes: 145\n",
    "Percentage of missing values: ~32%\n",
    "\n",
    "32% seems like a lot, but it is scattered accross every attributte, and often doesn't signify that a value is missing, but that it doesn't exist (state_code, foor example, is missing in any row where the country isn't US).\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that we removed non US data when doing some of the below tasks. This is because the highest investitions are placed into US companies (and they also make up over 1/4 of  the data)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Basic information\n",
    "Map of startup density by the US state. We can see that by far the most companies are founded in California:\n",

    "As we can see, the startup world has constantly grow, especially in the last few years.\n",
    "## 3. Industry sectors\n",
    "Grouping together sectors/categories, we can see which of them have more companies, and also more total investments. We can see that most companies are in the tech sector, which makes sense, because it's a newere and boomin industry. The highest investments are made into biotech.\n",
