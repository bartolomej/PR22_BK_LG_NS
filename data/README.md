## Context
The startup world is flourishing. There are hundreds of new companies being founded each day and venture capital has become a substantial asset class with yearly investments exceeding $100B in the US alone. Crunchbase 2013 Snapshot ¬© 2013 dataset provides a glimpse into this exciting world.

I hope you enjoy and learn while working with the data! üëç

## Content
This diverse dataset contains information about the startup ecosystem: organizations, individuals, company news, funding rounds, acquisitions, and IPOs.

There are 11 tables that can be joined using unique IDs (schema to follow). More information about the individual data variables can be found on the Crunchabse Data website (under the API Entities Types section).

No extensive data quality check have been performed yet. The information is available up to December 2013.

While Kaggle contains other datasets focused on startup investments, to the best of my knowledge, this dataset has not yet been published on the platform and is unique.
