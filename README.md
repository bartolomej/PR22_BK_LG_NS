# Startup analysis

## Getting started

### 1. Install git-lfs
To setup this project locally using Git, you will need to install a git extension called [`git-lfs`](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs). This is due to the file size limit that can be tracked using Git, [imposed by Github](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github#about-size-limits-on-github).

To install `git-lfs`, follow the installation instructions for your platform, [here](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Installation).

You can validate the installation with command: `git lfs --version `

### 2. Python and Jupyter

To use notebooks in this repo, you will need to have Python and Jupyter installed on your system.

Installation instructions for Jupyter: https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/install.html

### 3. Clone the repo

Once you've installed all the prerequisites, you can clone the repo and run the project.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/bartolomej/PR22_BK_LG_NS
```
